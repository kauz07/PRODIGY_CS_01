# Caesar Cipher Generator

## Overview
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Generator! This is a simple Python program that allows you to encrypt or decrypt text using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions.

## How it Works
The program takes input text and a shift value from the user. It then encrypts or decrypts the text based on the provided shift value using the Caesar cipher algorithm. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged during the process.

## Getting Started
To use the Caesar Cipher Generator, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input text and the desired shift value.
5. The program will output the encrypted or decrypted text.

## Example
Let's say you want to encrypt the text "Hello, World!" with a shift of 3. Here's how you can do it:

Enter text to encrypt/decrypt: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3

The output will be:
Encrypted/Decrypted text: Khoor, Zruog!
